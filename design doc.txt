 3 abilities to acquire
	- wall slide/jump
	- slide
	- ???

abilities should be able to be used anywhere and be multi purpose
should enhance the players overall movement

level design:
	metroid vania, backtracking, dark souls doors, all that

	player needs to collect 10 something orbs ( can be whatever ) to open a door and beat the game
	opening the door leads to a cool time based escape level something, cinematic

	when introducing the door, have the door be one of the first things the player sees. then have the only way forwards lead to the first collectable. after obtaining the first collectable, have the forward moving path lead back into the door room, where the player can then realize that the collectable they picked up affected the door. in the room where you get the collectable, place a switch that opens a door in the first starting room, which makes sure that players will have to pass through the door room

	have hidden areas, that become visible when the player enters them

level objects:
	trigger that sets a timer. at the end of the timer, the player will spontaneously die. a second trigger will disable the timer, allowing the player to continue. This will occasionally force the player to move fast.
	
	switch that the player must activate manually. the switch can activate doors
	
	checkpoint
	
	crumbly platform of course
